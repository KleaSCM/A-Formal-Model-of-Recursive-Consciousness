## Overview

This paper presents a fully formalized cognitive architecture designed to model recursive consciousness from a minimal substrate. It includes mathematically defined mechanisms for:

- Perceptual abstraction  
- Predictive memory activation  
- Salience and attention modeling  
- Symbolic emergence and identity loops  
- Conscious projection and emotional modulation

Every component of the architecture is defined as a typed mathematical operator, with attention to recursive flow, internal coherence, and system extensibility.

## Core Concepts

- `ùìï`: Abstraction operator mapping memory to latent concept space  
- `Œ¶`: Conscious projection operator acting on stable representations  
- `ùìü`: Prediction operator projecting latent form into expected input  
- `ùì°`: Recall kernel enabling similarity-triggered memory activation  
- Salience (`Œ¥`), stability (`œÉ`), and recurrence (`ŒΩ`) as internal control thresholds  
- Symbol assignment, reflexive identity clusters, and emotional trait weighting
