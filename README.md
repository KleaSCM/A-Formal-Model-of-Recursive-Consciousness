## Overview

This paper presents a fully formalized cognitive architecture designed to model recursive consciousness from a minimal substrate. It includes mathematically defined mechanisms for:

- Perceptual abstraction  
- Predictive memory reactivation  
- Salience and attention modeling  
- Symbolic emergence and identity loops  
- Conscious projection and emotional modulation

Every subsystem is defined as a typed operator within a recursive cognitive flow, with attention to internal coherence, extensibility, and symbolic integration.

## Core Components

- `ùìï`: Abstraction operator mapping memory to latent concept shape  
- `Œ¶`: Conscious projection operator selecting stable internal representations  
- `ùìü`: Prediction operator mapping latent concepts to expected percepts  
- `R`: Recall kernel reactivating concepts via perceptual similarity  
- `Œ¥`, `œÉ`, `ŒΩ`: Salience, stability, and recurrence thresholds  
- `Œ£`: Symbol assignment function enabling naming and linguistic reference  
- Recursive identity loops, trait weighting, and affect-driven reinforcement
